In order for the transforms to work you need to have the following 2 components installed:\r\n\r\n**1. Maltego**\r\n**2. Canari Framework**\r\n\r\n**1. Maltego**\r\n\r\nDownload Maltego from their website or if you are using BackTrack/Kali its installed by default.\r\n\r\n* Run Maltego so it creates the required folders and directory structure\r\n* Go through the default configuration for the first run (that wizard thing)\r\n* Close Maltego\r\n\r\n**2. Canari Framework**\r\n\r\nThe recommended method is to get Canari from the github repo here:\r\n\r\n[Canari Framework](https://github.com/allfro/canari.git)\r\n\r\nFrom the directory you wish to have Canari installed run the following commands:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/allfro/canari.git\r\n    cd canari\r\n    python setup.py install\r\n\r\nThis will install Canari and download the required dependencies.\r\n\r\nOnce installed you can test by running: \r\n\r\n    canari version\r\n\r\nYou should see something like this:\r\n\r\n    Your running *Canari Framework v1.0*\r\n \r\nYou are now ready to install sniffMyPackets...\r\n\r\nFrom your working directory clone the github repo using:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/catalyst256/sniffMyPackets.git\r\n    cd sniffMyPackets/src\r\n    canari create-profile sniffMyPackets -w [working directory] \r\n\r\n_**so in my case -w /root/localTransforms/sniffMyPackets/src**_\r\n\r\nThis will create a **sniffMyPackets.mtz** file\r\n\r\nOpen Maltego, click on the Maltego Icon in the toolbar, then Import - Import Configuration\r\n\r\nFollow the wizard to install the transforms, entities and machine into Maltego\r\n\r\nAll the sniffMyPackets transforms and entities are under the sniffMyPackets heading\r\n\r\nYou can find some YouTube videos showing the features [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOBHdguRGCqxMfmtb6VyFPboS1ExqkXk-)\r\n\r\nEnjoy!! :)\r\n","google":"UA-40735183-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
